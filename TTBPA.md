Things To Bug pwittrock About
=============================

*or help out myself with ;-)*

Quick fixes
-----------

- [generated] There's a lot of weird space above/below boilerplate in
  types.go
- [generated] code isn't gofmted by default
- [generated] code uses spaces, should use tabs
- [generated] fooclient should be fooClient
- [generated] fooclient should be FoosGetter, not whole API group
  interface
- [generate] make it clearer how to start kube informers.  It was pretty
  clear before, but it's not clear where it should go with inject (it's
  a tag now, which is super nice, but that needs to be clearer in the
  inline comment, which is a bit misleading)
- [generated] hack/boilerplate.go.txt doesn't do anything,
  boilerplate.go.txt needs to be in the root, it seems
- [generated] Make `CreateRecorder` move obvious
- [generated] suggest watchcontrollerof/watchtransformationof in comments
- [generated] Dockerfile should use ENTRYPOINT and CMD
- [generated] vendor's permissions are weird
- [generated] Dockerfile's second part should be FROM scratch (needs
  CGO_ENABLED=0)
- [generated] CRD spec lists `bool`, when it should be `boolean`, `int32`
  should be `integer`
- [generated] CRD spec `nil` vs `[]`

Docs
----

- What's the purpose of eventhandlers.Path?  It has no godoc

Quick Features
--------------

- kube-builder should autogen json tags when it can
- Have an opinion on logging with verbosity (or tracing?)
- makefile or something to save typing `kubebuilder` all the
- implement string for `ReconcileKey`
- why doesn't ObjToKey use a reconcilekey?

Bigger Features
---------------

- Tracing in generated code/library code (context, open-tracing?)
- Autogenerated typed indexers, or at least a better way to deal with
  indexers (ReconcileKey doesn't implement to/from string, so it's
  difficult to use with indexers, it appears)
- Tests should encourage writing unit or behavioral tests against small
  chunks in addition to e2e tests.  e2e tests or integration tests should
  be in a separate folder.
- [generated] unit-style tests (even with bdd conventions) are *really*
  frustrating to write.  It should be easy to create InjectArgs with
  a fake set of clients, etc.
